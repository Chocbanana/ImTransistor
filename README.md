ImTransistor
============

**Image Transition Animator**

## Version

1.0.3

## Description

ImTransistor creates a series of frames (and movie if option selected) between two images, depicting a gradual pixel-by-pixel transition between them. This can be used for a variety of applications and visualizations, the most common being for slideshows and logo animations. 

Command line arguments are 2 images of the same size, and can be in .jpg, .bmp, or .png formats. The program will convert them to black and white, and ask for the number of frames to be created; currently, the movie outputs at 30fps. Make sure there is no folder named “Output” in the same directory!


### Future Work

- Add GUI
- Include different transition options
- Improve speed of program
