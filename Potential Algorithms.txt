Potential Algorithms
====================

## Algorithm Needs:
- Must be able to move all pixels at same time
- Treat lines as “objects”, grouping pixels
- Optimize moving pixels vs. deleting vs. creating
- Treat moving current pixels to optimum location as one action, then “fitting to final image” as another?

#### Image Deformation Using Least Squares
- http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/schaefer/research/mls.pdf
- Pros:
  * Complete, researched
  * Uses rigid transformations, so surroundings-aware
- Cons:
  * Complicated
  * Not directly applicable to project (at all really)


#### Unity sprite AI least-path
- Pros:
  * Complete, easily implementable
- Cons:
  * Made for much less objects than number of pixels in image 

#### Seam Carving
- Used for finding least path for one pixel given static image
- Applicable here??

#### Flood fill
- Use for determining lineart “objects”, or for changing/converting colors
